# Interview Scheduler

This project was our first deep-dive into using the react library / framework, and also a major bump in testing experience, writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with Jest and Cypress. We explored many key concepts of using react, including but not limited to JSX, useState, useEffect, and custom hooks. While the design / CSS was provided for us, the Scheduler project proved to be another great exercise in modular coding and full-stack development.
